# Service Catalog

Service Catalog is a Kubernetes Incubator project that provides a
Kubernetes-native workflow for integrating with 
[Open Service Brokers](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) 
to provision and bind to application dependencies like databases, object
storage, message-oriented middleware, and more.

For more information, 
[visit the project on github](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog).

To install, we recommend that you have a Kubernetes 1.7 cluster. When you have
one available, see the 
[installation documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/blob/master/docs/install-1.7.md).
